                  Womaritime Experts was born out of a deep understanding of both the operational 
                  and strategic needs of the maritime industry. After years at sea including making 
                  history as Africa's first female dredge master and later serving as Maritime 
                  Compliance Manager and Designated Person Ashore (DPA) for one of South Africa's 
                  largest state-owned entities, our founder, Londy Ngcobo, identified a crucial gap: 
                  the need for stronger alignment between onboard operations and shore-based strategy, 
                  and the visible underrepresentation of women in technical and advisory roles across 
                  the ocean economy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In response to the reality that women make up less than 2% of the maritime workforce, 
                  Womaritime Experts was founded not as a movement, but as a high-impact service company 
                  that delivers tangible results while championing greater representation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today, our team of maritime professionals, consultants, and sector leaders reflects 
                  the strength, excellence, and diversity that continues to drive Africa's ocean economy 
                  forward. From boardrooms to shipyards, and from training rooms to global stages, we 
                  lead with purpose and the bold belief that transformation is not a side agendaâ€”it is 
                  a strategic advantage.
